<p>My name is Marissa, and I’m in my 20s. I’m currently living in eastern part of the United States working from home as a customer service associate. But, in my free time, I make gaming videos on YouTube (If you'd like to check me out, my name is NovaBlaStarr on YouTube). I’m still not 100% sure on what I’d like to do for a career, but for now I’m going to school for computer science. I’ve always had so many ideas about what I wanted to do when I grew up. But, I didn’t have a nurturing environment for me to explore my ideas. I was met with a lot of negativity, which left me lost on what I should do. I kind of lost motivation, and did have any drive or idea what I should do as a career. My father always want me have a technical career like him, so I started going to school for it. I've been learning so much during my time in school and giving real through to my career. I’ve been narrowing down my options, and I think I’d like to work with my hands if possible. Making custom gaming PC looks really cool, plus seeing custom gaming PC just make me feel inspired for some reason. It could be due to my love of PC gaming, but it's a start in the right direction. I wouldn’t mind and I know that isn’t healthy.</p>
<p>I’m going to be graduating after my computer technology intermediate capstone class. And I’m really excited.  This is my last class before graduating this year, and I know I want to come back for my bachelors. I might take a little break in-between, graduation and going back for my bachelors. Since I’m still deciding on what I want to do, on my break I’m going to give it a little more thought. Whether I’ll stick with technology or try a different route. I guess we’ll all have to wait and see what the future holds for me. But for now, I’m hoping to pass my Capstone class with flying colors, so I can start planning for my graduation.</p>
