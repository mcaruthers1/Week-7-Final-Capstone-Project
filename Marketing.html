<h3>Business Context</h3>
<p>The purpose of the application is provided people with the help and information they need to avoid life threatening situation. I hope the outcome for is this application is longevity not only for the application, but the people who use it. The main feature that’ll set us apart from other application and 411 is the questionnaire and first aid instructions. While waiting for emergency services, the application will ask question to deduce basic things you could do while waiting for EMTs.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Marketing plan</h3>
<p>My marketing plan is to create  demo video and share it on our social media site. And use “word of mouth” to boaster downloads. Simultaneously, I’d like to pay other YouTuber to advertise the application. The name way this application will make money will be base solely on downloads. So really showing the importance of the application is Super important.</p>
