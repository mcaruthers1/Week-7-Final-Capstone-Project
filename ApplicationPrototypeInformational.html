<h3>Goal in Mind</h3>
<p>The purpose of the application is provided people with the help and information they need to avoid life threatening situation. I hope the outcome for is this application is longevity not only for the application, but the people who use it. The main feature that’ll set us apart from other application and 411 is the questionnaire and first aid instructions. While waiting for emergency services, the application will ask question to deduce basic things you could do while waiting for EMTs.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Brief Description</h3>
<p>I’ve given this a lot of through and I think this app might be hard to develop, but is very necessary. My idea for my app project is an application that could assist in medical emergency situations. Some years ago, I found myself in a medical situation with no idea what to do. I was alone and afraid, and I could barely breath. Thank goodness, I was able to speak enough to call 411 for an ambulance, but my mind always thinks: what if I wasn’t able to speak. Or, what if I would’ve passed out in my apartment. I was lucky because I had prior knowledge of what to do in those types of situation (call 411, and get to a place where people can easily access you).</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Functional Specification</h3>
<p>This application will be available on Android and iOS. For android the code will be written in JavaScript, while iOS will be written in objective-C. The application is 150MB: recommended RAM size is between 8GB to 12GB. The application can run on Android 13 and higher and iOS 17 and higher.</p>
