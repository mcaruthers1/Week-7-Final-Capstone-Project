<h3>Requesting emergency services</h3>
<p>Locate the RESWHP application on your smart devices. Press the application to launch the software. A short animation will be reformed showing the logo for the application. The following question will populate: Is this a medical emergency? There will be a “Yes” button and “No” button. Press and hold the “Yes” button (This feature in put in place in case of wrong selection). There will be a buildup on the “Yes” button and a chime sound will let you know that the selection has been made. The application will then ask for permission to use the GPS to pinpoint the user. If you give the application permission it will pinpoint your location and confirm whether or not the address is correct (If you don’t give permission, you’ll have to enter the address manually). If so, it’ll request emergency services to your location and provided user with an estimated ETA of arrival (if not, it’ll have the user put in the address manually). While waiting for emergency services, the application will ask a series of question to help with your medical emergency, while you wait for EMTs.</p>
